      "Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must.",

This book is both an example-driven programmer's guide and a keep-on-your-desk reference, with new chapters that explain everything you need to know to get the most out of JavaScript, including: Scripted HTTP and Ajax XML processing Client-side graphics using the canvas tag Namespaces in JavaScript--essential when writing complex programs Classes, closures, persistence, Flash, and JavaScript embedded in Java applications Part I explains the core JavaScript language in detail. If you are new to JavaScript, it will teach you the language. If you are already a JavaScript programmer, Part I will sharpen your skills and deepen your understanding of the language. Part II explains the scripting environment provided by web browsers, with a focus on DOM scripting with unobtrusive JavaScript. The broad and deep coverage of client-side JavaScript is illustrated with many sophisticated examples that demonstrate how to: Generate a table of contents for an HTML document Display DHTML animations Automate form validation Draw dynamic pie charts Make HTML elements draggable Define keyboard shortcuts for web applications Create Ajax-enabled tool tips Use XPath and XSLT on XML documents loaded with Ajax And much more Part III is a complete reference for core JavaScript. It documents every class, object, constructor, method, function, property, and constant defined by JavaScript 1.5 and ECMAScript Version 3. Part IV is a reference for client-side JavaScript, covering legacy web browser APIs, the standard Level 2 DOM API, and emerging standards such as the XMLHttpRequest object and the canvas tag. More than 300,000 JavaScript programmers around the world have madethis their indispensable reference book for building JavaScript applications. \"A must-have reference for expert JavaScript programmers...well-organized and detailed.\" -- Brendan Eich, creator of JavaScript",

      "In the usual process of control system design, the assumption is made that the controller is implemented exactly. This assumption is usually reasonable, since clearly, the plant uncertainty is the most significant source of uncertainty in the control system, while controllers are implemented with high-precision hardware. However, inevitably, there will be some amount of uncertainty in the controller, a fact that is largely ignored in existing modern advanced robust control techniques. If the controller is implemented by analogue means, there are some tolerances in the analogue components. More commonly, the controller will be implemented digitally, and consequently there will be uncertainty involved with the quantization in the analogue-digital conversion and rounding in the parameter representation and in the numerical computations. A failure to account for these uncertainties in the controller may result in a controller that is \"fragile\". A controller is fragile in the sense that very small perturbations in the coefficients of the designed controller destabilize the closed-loop control system. This book collects a number of articles which consider the problems of finite-precision computing in digital controllers and filters. Written by leading researchers, topics that the book covers include: - analysis of fragility and finite-precision effects; - design of optimal controller realizations; - design of non-fragile robust controllers; - design of low-complexity digital controllers; - analysis of quantization effects in fuzzy controllers.",

      "The best modern JavaScript is simple, readable, and predictable. Learn to write modern JavaScript not by memorizing a list of new syntax, but with practical examples of how syntax changes can make code more expressive. Starting from variable declarations that communicate intention clearly, see how modern principles can improve all parts of code. Incorporate ideas with curried functions, array methods, classes, and more to create code that does more with less while yielding fewer bugs. It's time to write JavaScript code that's clean and exprssive. Modern JavaScript is simpler and more predictable and readable than ever. Discover how to write better code with clear examples using principles that show how updated syntax can make code better with fewer bugs. Starting from the ground up, learn new syntax (or how to reuse older syntax) to transform code from clunky bug-susceptible scripts to clear and elegant programs that are easy to read and easy to extend. Create a foundation for readable code with simple variable declarations that reduce side effects and subtle bugs. Select collections with clear goals instead of defaulting to objects or arrays. See how to simplify iterations from complex loops to single line array methods. Master techniques for writing flexible and solid code ranging from high-order functions, to reusableclasses, to patterns for architecting large applications creating applications that will last while through rounds of refactoring and changing requirements. The best part is there's no need to read this book straight through. Jump around and incorporate new functionality at will. Most importantly, understand not just what the new syntax is, but when and how to use it. Start writing better code from the first page. What You Need: For the best experience, have the latest version of Node installed (at least version 7). You can test most examples in the console of Chrome or other modern web browser. If you'd like to run the tests, you'll also need to install the latest version of Node Package Manager (npm).",

      "Stéphane Hessel, recently published a short pamphlet titled “Get Angry” (Indignez-vous). In it, Hessel asserts that today’s youth should assume the same indignation that his generation in its turn had against Nazism and capitalism, as well as indignation against financial capital inequality what Israel does in Palestine (it is worth remembering that Hessel is Jewish) and the indifference that has gripped the world in the face of the injustices and inefficiencies of the current financial economic system. It is a beautiful text, less than 30 pages long, and has been largely successful. I bought the 13th edition in French in Hamburg. Next to a bookshop in a café Balzac, I read the entire text and, inspired by Hessel, who I would meet some months after, wrote this “React”.",

This report examines the completed acquisition by Vue of the company A3 Cinema Ltd, including its subsidiary company Ster Century (which operates cinemas in Basingstoke, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Leeds, Norwich and Romford). The Commission concludes that the merger has resulted in a substantial lessening of competition (SLC) in the cinema market in relation to Basingstoke, likely to result in higher cinema ticket prices, and reduced choice for consumers. It recommends that in order to remedy this problem, Vue must secure the divestment of one cinema in Basingstoke to another cinema operator with sufficient resources to ensure its operation as a multiplex cinema showing mainstream films.",

      "Node.js is a JavaScript interpreter and runtime system which has made the use of JavaScript a feasible and attractive option for server-side programming. Its combination of an efficient interpreter with an event-driven library makes Node.js especially suitable for Web applications that deal with many requests. Express is a Web application framework built on top of Node.js that relieves developers of the burden of some of the repetitive tasks of Web development. Written for professional and student Web developers, this book provides a clear and concise introduction to the kind of JavaScript programming that will allow readers to take advantage of Node.js and Express to create Web applications. Drawing on a deep understanding of programming languages and many years of practical experience in Web application development, the authors explain functions and objects, Node.js's system of modules, and the use of callbacks in asynchronous programming. A small complete application, using Express and a relational database, is built and described in detail. The two final chapters are devoted to the important topic of testing. Clear key points summarize each section, links to relevant Web sites are included, and technical terms are defined in an 8-page glossary. Topics covered include: Functions and closures Objects and prototypes Modules Asynchronous callbacks and events Building a simple application using Express Unit testing and integration testing This is not a general introduction to JavaScript. It is assumed that readers already have some experience using JavaScript for client-side scripting and are familiar with the basic syntax, built-in data types and control structures.

      "The Comprehensive Book on Express.js The in-depth, detailed, hand-on manual on Express.js, the most popular Node.js framework. Will get you up and running fast and save you time. Understand the concepts, learn the best practices. Become an Express.js expert today. Express.js API reference, quick start guides, 20+ meticulously explained examples and tutorials -- over 270 pages with more than 60 illustrations. Quick Start The Interface TIps and Tricks Tutorials and Examples Why Express.js is the most popular Node.js web framework yet. As of this writing (September of 2013), there are no books that are solely dedicated to it. Its official website has bits of insights for advanced Node.js programmers. However, I found that many people -- including those who go through HackReactor7 program and come to my Node.js classes at General Assembly and pariSOMA -- are interested in a comprehensive resource. The one that would cover all the different components of Express.js work together in a real production-like application. The goal of Express.js Guide is to become such resource. What This Book is Express.js Guide is a concise book on one particular library. This book contains Express.js API 3.3.58 description, the best practices on code organization and patterns, real-world examples of web apps. The topics include but not limited to middleware, command-line interface and scaffolding, ren- dering templates, extracting params from dynamic URLs, parsing payloads and cookies, managing authentication with sessions, error handling and prepping apps for production. For more details and for what exactly the book covers, please refer to the Table of Contents. What This Book is Not This book is not an introduction to Node.js, nor is it a book that covers all aspects of building a modern day web application, e.g., websockets, databases and (of course) front-end development. Keep in mind that readers also won't find in Express.js Guide a resource for learning programming and/or JavaScript fundamentals. You might want to take a look at Rapid Prototyping with JS9 for the introduction to Node.js, MongoDB and front-end development with Backbone.js. In the real-world and especially in Node.js development, due to its modularized philosophy, we seldom use just a single framework. In the book, we have tried to stick only to Express.js and leave everything else out as much as possible, without compromising the usefulness of examples. Therefore, we intentionally left out some important chunks of web developments, for example databases, authentication and testing. Although these elements are present in tutorials and examples, they're not explained in detail. For those materials, you could check books in the Related Reading and Resources section at the end of the book. Who This Book is For This book is for people fluent in programming and front-end JavaScript. In addition, to get the most benefits, readers must be familiar with basic Node.js concepts like process and global, and know core modules, including streams, clusters and buffer type. If you're thinking of starting a Node.js app, or of rewriting an existing one, and your weapon of choice is Express.js -- this guide is for you! It will answer most of your \"how\" and \"why\" questions.",

      "Practical Node.js is your step-by-step guide to learning how to build a wide range of scalable real-world web applications using a professional development toolkit. Node.js is an innovative and highly efficient platform for creating web services. But Node.js doesn't live in a vacuum! In a modern web development, many different components need to be put together — routing, database driver, ORM, session management, OAuth, HTML template engine, CSS compiler and many more. If you already know the basics of Node.js, now is the time to discover how to bring it to production level by leveraging its vast ecosystem of packages. As a web developer, you'll work with a varied collection of standards and frameworks - Practical Node.js shows you how all those pieces fit together. Practical Node.js takes you from installing all the necessary modules to writing full-stack web applications by harnessing the power of the Express.js and Hapi frameworks, the MongoDB database with Mongoskin and Mongoose, Jade and Handlebars template engines, Stylus and LESS CSS languages, OAuth and Everyauth libraries, and the Socket.IO and Derby libraries, and everything in between. The book also covers how to deploy to Heroku and AWS, daemonize apps, and write REST APIs. You'll build full-stack real-world Node.js apps from scratch, and also discover how to write your own Node.js modules and publish them on NPM. You already know what Node.js is; now learn what you can do with it and how far you can take it!",

Book Description The MERN stack is a collection of great tools—MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node—that provide a strong base for a developer to build easily maintainable web applications. With each of them a JavaScript or JavaScript-based technology, having a shared programming language means it takes less time to develop web applications. This book focuses on providing key tasks that can help you get started, learn, understand, and build full-stack web applications. It walks you through the process of installing all the requirements and project setup to build client-side React web applications, managing synchronous and asynchronous data flows with Redux, and building real-time web applications with Socket.IO, RESTful APIs, and other concepts. This book gives you practical and clear hands-on experience so you can begin building a full-stack MERN web application.

      "Rapid Prototyping with JS: Agile JavaScript Development is a hands-on book which introduces you to agile JavaScript web and mobile software development using the latest cutting-edge front-end and back-end technologies including: Node.js, Backbone.js, MongoDB and others. More information at http://rpjs.co. This book was borne out of frustration. I have been in software engineering for many years, and when I started learning Node.js and Backbone.js, I learned the hard way that their official documentation and the Internet lack in quick start guides and examples. Needless to say, it was virtually impossible to find all of the tutorials for JS-related modern technologies in one place. The best way to learn is to do, right? Therefore, I've used the approach of small simple examples, i.e., quick start guides, to expose myself to the new cool tech. After I was done with the basic apps, I needed some references and organization. I started to write this manual mostly for myself, so I can understand the concepts better and refer to the samples later. Then StartupMonthly and I taught a few 2-day intensive classes on the same subject -- helping experienced developers to jump-start their careers with agile JavaScript development. The manual we used was updated and iterated many times based on the feedback received. The end result is this book. What to Expect A typical reader of RPJS should expect a collection of quick start guides, tutorials and suggestions (e.g., Git workflow). There is a lot of coding and not much theory. All the theory we cover is directly related to some of the practical aspects, and essential for better understanding of technologies and specific approaches in dealing with them, e.g., JSONP and cross-domain calls. In addition to coding examples, the book covers virtually all setup and deployment step-by-step. You'll learn on the examples of Chat web/mobile applications starting with front-end components. There are a few versions of these applications, but by the end we'll put front-end and back-end together and deploy to the production environment. The Chat application contains all of the necessary components typical for a basic web app, and will give you enough confidence to continue developing on your own, apply for a job/promotion or build a startup! Who This Book is For The book is designed for advanced-beginner and intermediate-level web and mobile developers: somebody who has been (or still is) an expert in other languages like Ruby on Rails, PHP, Perl, Python or/and Java. The type of a developer who wants to learn more about JavaScript and Node.js related techniques for building web and mobile application prototypes fast. Our target user doesn't have time to dig through voluminous (or tiny, at the other extreme) official documentation. The goal of Rapid Prototyping with JS is not to make an expert out of a reader, but to help him/her to start building apps as soon as possible. Rapid Prototyping with JS: Agile JavaScript Development, as you can tell from the name, is about taking your idea to a functional prototype in the form of a web or a mobile application as fast as possible. This thinking adheres to the Lean Startup30 methodology; therefore, this book would be more valuable to startup founders, but big companies' employees might also find it useful, especially if they plan to add new skills to their resumes. What This Book is Not Rapid Prototyping with JS is neither a comprehensive book on several frameworks, libraries or technologies (or just a particular one), nor a reference for all the tips and tricks of web development. Examples similar to ones in this book might be publicly available online. Even more so, if you're not familiar with fundamental programming concepts like loops, if/else statements, arrays, hashes, object and functions, you won't find them in Rapid Prototyping with JS.",

      "Design, build, and deliver efficient Java applications using the most advanced NoSQL database About This Book Reuse the skills you have acquired through Hibernate or Spring to promote your applications to use NoSQL storage Explore the list of libraries that are already available to assist you in developing Java EE applications with MongoDB A step-by-step tutorial to create leaner and faster applications using MongoDB Who This Book Is For This book is for Java developers and architects that want to learn how to develop Java applications using the most popular NoSQL solution and the use cases of it. What You Will Learn Install MongoDB and its client tools Set up a basic project that uses a MongoDB driver and perform CRUD operations with it Explore simple strategies for mapping Mongo documents with Java classes Use bulk operations to speed up the creation of massive document Design and develop a Java Enterprise application that uses MongoDB as storage Develop and deploy an application that uses Hibernate OGM as a persistence layer for your entities Use Spring Data and Spring Boot to leverage micro-services using MongoDB as storage In Detail The NoSQL movement is growing in relevance, attracting more and more developers. The MongoDB database is a well-recognized rising star in the NoSQL world. It is a document database, which allows data persistence and enables you to query data in a nested state without any schema constraint and complex joins between documents. This book provides all the knowledge you need to make MongoDB fit in your application schema, at the best of its capabilities. It starts from a basic introduction to the driver that can be used to perform some low-level interaction with the storage. Then it moves to use different patterns to abstract the persistence layer into your applications, starting from the flexible Google JSON library to the Hibernate OGM Framework and finally landing on the Spring data framework. By the end of this book, you will know everything you need to use MongoDB in your Java applications. Style and approach A simple, tutorial-like approach is used to explain the concepts contained in the book in the simplest possible way. The chapters of this book are arranged so that complexity increases progressively as you gain more experience from the earlier chapters.",

      "Best-selling author, Walter Savitch, uses a conversational style to teach programmers problem solving and programming techniques with Java. Readers are introduced to object-oriented programming and important computer science concepts such as testing and debugging techniques, program style, inheritance, and exception handling. It includes thorough coverage of the Swing libraries and event driven programming. The Java coverage is a concise, accessible introduction that covers key language features. Thorough early coverage of objects is included, with an emphasis on applications over applets. The author includes a highly flexible format that allows readers to adapt coverage of topics to their preferred order. Although the book does cover such more advanced topics as inheritance, exception handling, and the Swing libraries, it starts from the beginning, and it teaches traditional, more basic techniques, such as algorithm design. The volume provides concise coverage of computers and Java objects, primitive types, strings, and interactive I/O, flow of control, defining classes and methods, arrays, inheritance, exception handling, streams and file I/O, recursion, window interfaces using swing objects, and applets and HTML.

    "description":
      "With remarkable scope and in scrupulous detail, Professor Anderson analyzes the Indonesian revolution of 1945. Against the background of Javanese culture and the Japanese occupation, he explores the origins of the revolutionary youth groups, the military, and the political parties to challenge conventional interpretations of revolutionary movements in Asia. The author emphasizes that the critical role in the outbreak was played not by the dissatisfied intellectuals or by an oppressed working class but by the youth of Indonesia. Perhaps most important are the insights he offers into the conflict between strategies for seeking national revolution and those for attaining social change. By giving first priority to gaining recognition of Indonesian sovereignty from the outside world, he argues, the revolutionary leadership had to adopt conservative domestic policies that greatly reduced the possibility of far-reaching social reform. This in-depth study of the independence crisis in Indonesia, brought back to life by Equinox Publishing as the first title in it's Classic Indonesia series, also illuminates the revolutionary process in other nations, where wars for independence have been fought but significant social and economic progress has not yet been achieved. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Benedict Anderson is one of the world's leading authorities on South East Asian nationalism and particularly on Indonesia. He is Professor of International Studies and Director of the Modern Indonesia Project at Cornell University, New York. His other works include Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism and The Spectre of Comparisons: Nationalism, Southeast Asia, and the World.",

      "Bluetooth is a technology for wireless communication that functions in much the same way that home/office laptops connect to the Internet. It is typically used for short burst communications instead of a continuous connection. Because of this difference, Bluetooth is more typically found supported in wireless phones and personal devices. Bluetooth for Java is not an overview of Bluetooth. In the book, Bruce Hopkins and Ranjith Antony describe how to develop wireless Java applications using Bluetooth for a variety of platforms. This includes an API overview of the Java library, development of Bluetooth-based services, highlights of security concerns, and walkthroughs for development with some of the different tools available. Programs will not be just J2ME (micro devices)-based, but will also be for J2SE (client/desktop).",

      "Named after the Monty Python comedy troupe, Python is an interpreted, open-source, object-oriented programming language. It's also free and runs portably on Windows, Mac OS, Unix, and other operating systems. Python can be used for all manner of programming tasks, from CGI scripts to full-fledged applications. It is gaining popularity among programmers in part because it is easier to read (and hence, debug) than most other programming languages, and it's generally simpler to install, learn, and use. Its line structure forces consistent indentation. Its syntax and semantics make it suitable for simple scripts and large programs. Its flexible data structures and dynamic typing allow you to get a lot done in a few lines. To learn it, you'll need is some basic programming experience and a copy of Python: Visual QuickStart Guide. In patented Visual QuickStart Guide fashion, the book doesn't just tell you how to use Python to develop applications, it shows you, breaking Python into easy-to-digest, step-by-step tasks and providing example code. Python: Visual QuickStart Guide emphasizes the core language and libraries, which are the building blocks for programs. Author Chris Fehily starts with the basics - expressions, statements, numbers, strings - then moves on to lists, dictionaries, functions, and modules before wrapping things up with straightforward discussions of exceptions and classes. Some additional topics covered include:- Object-oriented programming- Working in multiple operating systems- Structuring large programs- Comparing Python to C, Perl, and Java- Handling errors gracefully.",

      "This book has been written with two categories of readers in mind. This book can be manual for those who would want to excel in Python programming as well as for those who are new to Python programming and would want to learn. I hope that you will find what follows both instructive and at times entertaining too. The book is designed for programmers who already have some experience of using a modern high level procedural programming language like C/ C++. The book concentrates on the things that are essential to understand Python programming. Those who already know C will find the contents and example code snippets a bit interested. The syntax and coding constructs of Python programming paradigm is nearer to C but not exact. From my point of view, what matters for a programmer is \"Logic\" and \"Syntax\". It has been inevitable for programmers to learn and practice emerging programming paradigms. This is the first edition of the textbook hence a lot of brainstorming was required in order to properly structure each and every chapter. Appendix A addresses exercise questions of \"Python for Everybody\" by Charles R Severance. Appendix B is about Python solution to few commonly found programming problems. All the programs presented in the textbook are tested using PyCharm IDE. I hope the book meets the requirements of student fraternity and remains reachable throughout its multiple entry of editions. Also, PyCharm IDE installation guidelines included in the textbook.",

      "Programming is an important part of experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience, and Python is an ideal language for novices. It sports a very readable syntax, intuitive variable management, and a very large body of functionality that ranges from simple arithmetic to complex computing. Python for Experimental Psychologists provides researchers without prior programming experience with the knowledge they need to independently script experiments and analyses in Python. The skills it offers include: how to display stimuli on a computer screen; how to get input from peripherals (e.g. keyboard, mouse) and specialised equipment (e.g. eye trackers); how to log data; and how to control timing. In addition, it shows readers the basic principles of data analysis applied to behavioural data, and the more advanced techniques required to analyse trace data (e.g. pupil size) and gaze data. Written informally and accessibly, the book deliberately focuses on the parts of Python that are relevant to experimental psychologists and cognitive neuroscientists. It is also supported by a companion website where you will find colour versions of the figures, along with example stimuli, datasets and scripts, and a portable Windows installation of Python.",

You'll also be guided through new PHP programming language features like closures and namespaces. Pro PHP Programming deals with filtering data from users and databases next, so you'll be well prepared for relational and NoSQL databases. Of course, you can also learn about data retrieval from other sources, like OCR libraries or websites. Then the question of how to format and present data arises, and in Pro PHP Programming, you'll find solutions via JSON, AJAX and XML.",

      "All orders for the regular 11th Edition will be automatically upgraded to the Update Edition. Please note the following changes made to the 11e Update Edition. As the authors were researching material on the COBOL standard, they realized that the planned COBOL 2008 standard (discussed in the 11th edition) did not in fact occur. Some of the items marked as COBOL 2008 in the 11th edition had in fact changed in 2002, and some marked as COBOL 2008 will now finally be changed in the upcoming proposed COBOL 2013 standard. Therefore, in the Update Edition, we have changed the icons to indicate COBOL 2002 changes and the upcoming proposed COBOL 2013 changes. We removed all references to NetExpress, (which Wiley no longer distributes,) and added information on the new Micro Focus Academic Program. As of Summer 2013, members of this program are eligible to receive free licenses of Visual COBOL for teaching; free downloads of Visual COBOL Personal Edition for students; free online web support through community forums, blogs, and support network; and access to online software documentation and product manuals. Visit www.microfocus.com/bridgethegap for information on how to join. Some instructors reported that their students complained that the book felt dated, due to the older dates in code output. For a more contemporary feel, we changed these dates to the current year. We added program names to Practice Programs in the text for easier reference.",

      "This book introduces Computer Programming to a beginner, using Fortran 90 and its recent extension Fortran 95. While Fortran 77 has been used for many years and is currently very popular, computer scientists have been seriously concerned about good programming practice to promote development of reliable programs. Thus, the International Standards Organization set up a group to 'modernise' Fortran and introduce new features which have made languages such as Pascal and C popular. The committee took over a decade to come up with the new standard, Fortran 90. Fortran 90 has introduced many new features in Fortran, such as recursion, pointers, user-defined data types etc., which were hitherto available only in languages such as Pascal and C. Fortran 90 is not an evolutionary change of Fortran 77 but is drastically different. Though Fortran 77 programs can be run using a Fortran 90 compiler, Fortran 90 is so different that the author felt it was not a good idea to just revise Fortran 77 and introduce Fortran 90 in some places in the book. Thus this book is entirely new and introduces Fortran 90 from basics. In 1996 some small extensions were made to Fortran 90 and has called Fortran 95. This book also discusses these features. As all new programs in Fortran will henceforth be written in Fortran 90, it is essential for students to learn this language.The methodology of presentation, however, closely follows the one used by the author in his popular book on Fortran 77.",

Assuming no prior knowledge of computers or programming, the authors teach effective problem-solving and program-design techniques. The text emphasizes a software engineering approach to program design and carefully applies a five-step problem-solving approach: problem specification, analysis, design, implementation, and testing/verification. Koffman and Friedman provide thorough coverage of Fortran 77, with special sections on Fortran 90, and the techniques learned serve as a solid foundation for future programming regardless of the language used. New Features *On to C Chapter. This chapter provides a gentle introduction to C programming. Students learn C based on how they learned to program in Fortran. This new chapter replaces Chapters 11 and 12 in previous editions. *Updated Chapter 1. The Introduction to Computing chapter has been updated to reflect recent developments in industry.",

      "FORTRAN is written for students who have no prior knowledge of computers or programming. The book aims to teach students how to program using the FORTRAN language. The publication first elaborates on an introduction to computers and programming, introduction to FORTRAN, and calculations and the READ statement. Discussions focus on flow charts, rounding numbers, strings, executing the program, the WRITE and FORMAT statements, performing an addition, input and output devices, and algorithms. The text then takes a look at functions and the IF statement and the DO Loop, the IF-THEN-ELSE and the WHILE loop, including applications of the DO loop, the LOGICAL declaration statement, library functions, other applications of the IF statement, and writing REAL constants in exponential form. The manuscript ponders on subscripted variables, the DATA statement, and the implied DO loop, doubly subscripted variables and matrix multiplication, input/output, and functions, subprograms, and subroutines. Topics include statement functions, subprograms calling other subprograms, reading using X format, control characters, reading using F format, INTEGER subscripted variables, and matrix multiplication. The publication is a dependable source of data for computer programmers and students interested in the FORTRAN language.",

      "Fortran remains one of the principal languages used in scientific, numerical, and engineering programming, and a series of revisions to the standard versions of the language have progressively enhanced its power. The latest standard - Fortran 2003 - greatly extends the power of the language, by introducing object-oriented concepts, interoperability with C, better integration with operating systems and many other enhancements. This text details all these new features. Fortran 95/2003 Explained, significantly expands on the second edition of Fortran 90/95 Explained (also published by Oxford University Press): the opening chapters contain a complete description of the Fortran 95 language and are followed by descriptions of three formally approved extensions; six completely new chapters describe in detail the features that are new in Fortran 2003, but the distinction between the various language levels is kept clear throughout. Authored by three leading experts in the development of the language, this is a complete and authoritative description of the two languages (Fortran 95 and Fortran 2003). It is intended for new and existing users of Fortran, and for all those involved in scientific and numerical computing. It is suitable as textbook for teaching and, with its extensive index, as a handy reference for practitioners.",

      "This is the only Perl book that details practical applications that range from enabling cutting-edge research to integrating heterogeneous systems. More and more companies are using Perl as their language of choice for projects great and small in large part because of Perl's popularity among web CGI programmers. Perl's ability to quickly generate and manipulate text files, along with its flexibility in communicating with a variety of systems and platforms, make it indispensable. In many organizations, however, especially those with large-scale programming teams, Perl adopters still fight a daily battle for acceptance. Perl is perceived by the IT managers in these organizations as difficult to manage (because there's no one way to program), impossible to maintain (because deployment does not require compilation), prone to error (because its variables are weakly typed), and maybe even dangerous (because hackers use it). Applied Perl tackles these misperceptions through exploring cases where Perl is being applied inventively in the film industry, financial community, Internet community and scientific community. The book teaches new techniques to advanced Perl programmers and provides sample code and applications that can be customized. In addition it is an advocacy book that shows the power of the Perl language in tangible terms.",

      "The book has an introductory chapter that gets the reader started quickly with programming in Perl. The initial part of the book discusses Perl expressions, statements, control flow, built-in data types such as arrays and hashes, and complex data structures built using references. On Perl has several chapters covering specialized topics. The chapter on socket-based network programming deals with forking and using fork to write complex interactive client-server programs. There is a chapter with in-depth discussion of CGI programming including error-handling and security issues that arise. The chapter on web-client programming deals with writing programs that access Web pages, fill up GET and POST forms, handle cookies and redirected Web pages. The book has several unique chapters not found in any other book on Perl in the market. The chapter on security discusses hashes such as MD5, message authentication codes (MACs), digital signature schemes, and encryption techniques such as DES, Rijndael, and RSA. Other chapters deal with writing recursive programs that work with files and directories; this chapter also discusses predefined modules that deal with portability in file names and paths across operating systems, recursive traversal of file hierarchies and tarring and untarring of filles. The chapter on functional programming illustrates that Perl functions are first-class, can be used to write closures and can be composed to form more complex functions. In particular, this can be useful for programming in artificial intelligence.",

      "It's all in the name: Learn You a Haskell for Great Good! is a hilarious, illustrated guide to this complex functional language. Packed with the author's original artwork, pop culture references, and most importantly, useful example code, this book teaches functional fundamentals in a way you never thought possible. You'll start with the kid stuff: basic syntax, recursion, types and type classes. Then once you've got the basics down, the real black belt master-class begins: you'll learn to use applicative functors, monads, zippers, and all the other mythical Haskell constructs you've only read about in storybooks. As you work your way through the author's imaginative (and occasionally insane) examples, you'll learn to: –Laugh in the face of side effects as you wield purely functional programming techniques –Use the magic of Haskell's \"laziness\" to play with infinite sets of data –Organize your programs by creating your own types, type classes, and modules –Use Haskell's elegant input/output system to share the genius of your programs with the outside world Short of eating the author's brain, you will not find a better way to learn this powerful language than reading Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!",

      "Richard Bird is famed for the clarity and rigour of his writing. His new textbook, which introduces functional programming to students, emphasises fundamental techniques for reasoning mathematically about functional programs. By studying the underlying equational laws, the book enables students to apply calculational reasoning to their programs, both to understand their properties and to make them more efficient. The book has been designed to fit a first- or second-year undergraduate course and is a thorough overhaul and replacement of his earlier textbooks. It features case studies in Sudoku and pretty-printing, and over 100 carefully selected exercises with solutions. This engaging text will be welcomed by students and teachers alike.",

      "Elixir: A Human History of Water spans five millennia, from the beginnings of civilisation to the global water shortages of today. Our present-day interaction with this most essential resource has deep roots in the remote past, and every human culture has been shaped by its relationship to water. From the earliest hunter-gatherers, for whom knowing where to find water was a matter of life and death, through the Greek and Romans, whose mighty aqueducts still provide water for modern cities, to China, where emperors marshalled armies of labourers to tame the country's powerful rivers, every human culture has been shaped by its relationship with water. Medieval Europe, and then the Industrial Revolution, brought ingenious new solutions to water management and turned water into a commodity to be bought, sold, and exploited, and we still live at the mercy of the natural world for our most essential resource. Brian Fagan tells the story of 5,000 years of human endeavour. Deeply researched and elegantly written, Elixir illustrates that the past teaches us that technologies for solving one or another water problem are not enough. We still live at the mercy of the natural world and to solve the water crises of the future we may need to adapt the water ethos of our ancestors.",

      "This book is the introduction to Elixir for experienced programmers, completely updated for Elixir 1.6 and beyond. Explore functional programming without the academic overtones (tell me about monads just one more time). Create concurrent applications, butget them right without all the locking and consistency headaches. Meet Elixir, a modern, functional, concurrent language built on the rock-solid Erlang VM. Elixir's pragmatic syntax and built-in support for metaprogramming will make you productive and keep you interestedfor the long haul. Maybe the time is right for the Next Big Thing. Maybe it's Elixir. Functional programming techniques help you manage the complexities of today's real-world, concurrent systems; maximize uptime; and manage security. Enter Elixir, with its modern, Ruby-like, extendable syntax, compile and runtime evaluation, hygienic macro system, and more. But, just as importantly, Elixir brings a sense of enjoyment to parallel,functional programming. Your applications become fun to work with, and the language encourages you to experiment. Part 1 covers the basics of writing sequential Elixir programs. We'll look at the language, the tools, and the conventions. Part 2 uses these skills to start writing concurrent code-applications that use all the cores on your machine, or all the machines on your network! And we do it both with and without OTP. Part 3 looks at the more advanced features of the language, from DSLs and code generation to extending the syntax. This edition is fully updated with all the new features of Elixir 1.6, with a new chapter on structuring OTP applications, and new sections on the debugger, code formatter, Distillery, and protocols. What You Need: You'll need a computer, a little experience with another high-levellanguage, and a sense of adventure. No functional programmingexperience is needed.",

      "Leverage the power and flexibility of the Clojure language for finance About This Book Apply the Clojure programming language in financial analytics and to build financial applications Work with high-level mathematical abstractions without having to implement low-level code for financial operations. This is a practical tutorial that takes you through real-world examples of financial analytics and applications with Clojure Who This Book Is For If you're a finance professional who is currently using VBA (Excel) to perform financial calculations and quantitative analysis, and would like to use Clojure instead to improve their efficiency, then this book is for you. Basic knowledge of financial concepts is essential. Basic programming knowledge would also be an added advantage. What You Will Learn Quickly and effectively represent data and calculations using Clojure Use Clojure's basic language tools such as laziness, immutability, and firstclass functions to solve real-world problems Explore mathematical derivatives to generate different wave forms Get acquainted with the advanced approaches to calculating and transforming data, and building algorithms Use Clojure's functions to access, update, and compose data structures Be introduced to the concept of sideeffecting behavior and the different ways to handle it Compose simple and exponential functions together to get a buy or sell signal In Detail Clojure is a dynamic programming language with an emphasis on functional programming. Clojure is well suited to financial modeling as it is a functional programming language. Such languages help developers work with high-level mathematical abstractions without having to implement low-level code that handles the arithmetic operations. Starting with the importance of representing data and calculations effectively, this book will take you all the way to being competent in financial analytics and building financial applications. First, we introduce the notions of computation and finance, which will help you understand Clojure's utility to solve real-world problems in many domains, especially finance. Next, we will show you how to develop the simple-moving-average function by using the more advanced partition Clojure data transformation function. This function, along with others, will be used to calculate and manipulate data. You will then learn to implement slightly more complicated equations, how to traverse data, and deal with branching and conditional dispatch. Then, the concept of side-effecting and its various approaches are introduced, along with the strategy of how to use data as the interface to other systems. Finally, you will discover how to build algorithms while manipulating and composing functions. Style and approach This book is a practical step-by-step tutorial that provides a basic overview of the concepts but focuses on providing the skills required to analyze data.",

      "“There’s something for everyone here. . . . You can pick up and read this book and build an industry-standard system in a weekend: It has everything you need to get started with a new project. I also found it helpful in reviewing the structure of existing projects.” —Timothy Pratley, developer Developers are discovering the exceptional power of Clojure’s functional programming model to quickly solve problems in domains ranging from social networking to Big Data. Clojure is fast and efficient—ideal for rapid prototyping and lean development. And it is highly expressive and extremely extensible, which makes Clojure one of today’s leading tools for software innovation. Since it targets the Java Virtual Machine, Clojure also leverages the Java platform’s maturity and enormous ecosystem. Clojure Recipes is a wide-ranging, up-to-date “code recipe book” for this increasingly popular language. With practical and self-contained examples, author Julian Gamble illuminates Clojure’s key features and best practices, showing how to solve real-world problems one step at a time. Focusing on Clojure 1.7 and higher, Gamble fully reflects recent enhancements that ensure you’re getting the most up-to-date code for your project. Gamble first walks you through the essential steps required to set up your Clojure development environment, from setting up the Leiningen build tool to packaging Clojure for Java EE environments. He then shows you how to build both basic and advanced REST servers, before turning to a wide range of increasingly sophisticated applications. In this book you will find Innovative Clojure code for diverse web, security, administration, and development tasks, from log reading and app monitoring to software testing Detailed instructions for using concurrency primitives, writing new DSLs, simplifying cloud database development, and more “Learn by doing” projects, which offer practical experience with Clojurescript, Storm, Pedestal, Datomic, and other advanced tools Coverage of using Clojure with Cascalog 2.0 to write complex Hadoop queries with minimal code The breadth and quality of Gamble’s examples make Clojure Recipes uniquely valuable both to developers who are exploring Clojure for the first time and to those already using it in production.",

      "About this book · Gives the reader hands on example-base experience for simulating dynamical models in MATLAB®/Simulink® and animating them in VRML · More than 150 images describe each step in the model realizations helping readers to understand them visually · Diverse examples and profound problem treatment enable the reader to animate complex dynamical problems m-files, Simulink models, VRML files and jpegs available for download provide full solutions for the end-of-chapter problems Virtual Reality and Animation for MATLAB® and Simulink® Users demonstrates the simulation and animation of physical systems using the MATLAB® Virtual Reality Toolbox (virtual models are created in V-Realm Builder). The book is divided into two parts; the first addresses MATLAB® and the second Simulink®. The presentation is problem-based with each chapter teaching the reader a group of essential principles in the context of a step-by-step solution to a particular issue. Examples of the systems covered include mass-spring-dampers, a crank-slider mechanism and a moving vehicle. The examples are given in ascending level of difficulty and contain MATLAB®/Simulink® codes deliberately simplified so that readers can focus on: • understanding how to link a 3-d virtual scene to MATLAB®/Simulink®; and • manipulating the 3-d virtual scene in MATLAB®/Simulink®. When studied in sequence, the chapters of this text form a coherent whole enabling the reader to gain a thorough expertise in virtual simulation and animation of dynamical models using MATLAB®/Simulink®. Individual chapters stand on their own, however, so that readers interested in a particular system can concentrate on it easily. Problems are provided in each chapter to give practice in the techniques demonstrated and to extend the range of the systems studied, for example, into the control sphere. Solution code for these problems can be downloaded from insert URL. Whether modeling the dynamics of a simple pendulum, a robot arm or a moving car, animation of a dynamical model can enliven and encourage understanding of mechanical systems and thus contribute to control design. Virtual Reality and Animation for MATLAB® and Simulink® Users will be instructive and interesting to anyone, researcher or student, working with the dynamics of physical systems. Readers are assumed to have some familiarity with MATLAB®.",

      "Pascal 1623-1662 The moralist who advocated dressing up, the ascetic who liked a flutter, the devout Christian who lauded vanity, Pascal is a funnier, more ironic philosopher than his reputation as an anguished existentialist would suggest. Yet however irreverent the terms of his ironic project, its underlying impetus is both serious and profound. In this superb new introduction to the thinker and his thought, Ben Rogers demonstrates the deep wisdom of Pascal’s defence of popular folly – a defence which he used to highlight the higher delusions of the learned. Setting the Pensées in the context of Pascal’s life and philosophical career, Rogers reveals how their apparent frivolity underpins a fascinating, far-reaching and still challenging body of moral and political thought. His remarkable guide offers an eye-opening account of the work of a marvellous and much neglected thinker.",

These titles have proven valuable in a number of ways. Serving as standalone texts when tackling a philosophers' original sources or as helpful resources for focusing philosophy students' engagements with these philosopher's often conceptually daunting works, these titles have also gained extraordinary popularity with a lay readership and quite often serve as \"refreshers\" for philosophy instructors.",

      "By now you’ll have heard of ASP.NET MVC. This exciting new approach to developing ASP.NET web applications has taken the development world by storm over the last few years. Now a mature technology suitable for mainstream use, its adoption has exploded in recent times. Until recently, ASP.NET MVC was regarded as an advanced technology only suitable for experienced developers with a strong knowledge of classic ASP.NET and C# coding behind them. This book overturns that prejudice and shows that the beautiful simplicity of ASP.NET MVC is just as suitable for novice developers venturing into real-world application design for the first time. With the aid of a fully worked demo application this book explains and demonstrates for you the three pillars of MVC in action. You’ll see howthe Model, View and Controller patterns work together in a compliementary manner to provide MVC’s powerful results. There’s never been a better time to learn how to use ASP.NETMVC 4. The technology will speed your development times, reduce the verbosity of your code and simplify your application designs all at once. Take the first step towards ASP.NET MVC mastery with Beginning ASP.NET MVC 4. What you’ll learn How to get started with ASP.NET MVC. What tools and components you’ll need and how to download and set up the demo application on your system. Understand the details of the MVC pattern with deep-dives into each of the Model, View and Controller elements supported by working code showing them in action. How to apply and extend the MVC patterns to real world solutions: adding AJAX and jQuery, validation and securing user data, testing and deploying the finished application. All of these are discussed and demonstrated. Who this book is for This book is written for readers with basic ASP.NET expertise, such as you might gain from reading Beginning ASP.NET 4.5 in C#. You should be familiar with the underlying structure of ASP.NET applications and comfortable following examples that are underpinned with straight-forward C# code. If you've just found your feet with ASP.NET and are looking to take the next step on the road to mastery then this is the book for you.

      "The need to handle increasingly larger data volumes is one factor driving the adoption of a new class of nonrelational “NoSQL” databases. Advocates of NoSQL databases claim they can be used to build systems that are more performant, scale better, and are easier to program. NoSQL Distilled is a concise but thorough introduction to this rapidly emerging technology. Pramod J. Sadalage and Martin Fowler explain how NoSQL databases work and the ways that they may be a superior alternative to a traditional RDBMS. The authors provide a fast-paced guide to the concepts you need to know in order to evaluate whether NoSQL databases are right for your needs and, if so, which technologies you should explore further. The first part of the book concentrates on core concepts, including schemaless data models, aggregates, new distribution models, the CAP theorem, and map-reduce. In the second part, the authors explore architectural and design issues associated with implementing NoSQL. They also present realistic use cases that demonstrate NoSQL databases at work and feature representative examples using Riak, MongoDB, Cassandra, and Neo4j. In addition, by drawing on Pramod Sadalage’s pioneering work, NoSQL Distilled shows how to implement evolutionary design with schema migration: an essential technique for applying NoSQL databases. The book concludes by describing how NoSQL is ushering in a new age of Polyglot Persistence, where multiple data-storage worlds coexist, and architects can choose the technology best optimized for each type of data access.",

      "A hands-on guide to leveraging NoSQL databases NoSQL databases are an efficient and powerful tool for storing and manipulating vast quantities of data. Most NoSQL databases scale well as data grows. In addition, they are often malleable and flexible enough to accommodate semi-structured and sparse data sets. This comprehensive hands-on guide presents fundamental concepts and practical solutions for getting you ready to use NoSQL databases. Expert author Shashank Tiwari begins with a helpful introduction on the subject of NoSQL, explains its characteristics and typical uses, and looks at where it fits in the application stack. Unique insights help you choose which NoSQL solutions are best for solving your specific data storage needs. Professional NoSQL: Demystifies the concepts that relate to NoSQL databases, including column-family oriented stores, key/value databases, and document databases. Delves into installing and configuring a number of NoSQL products and the Hadoop family of products. Explains ways of storing, accessing, and querying data in NoSQL databases through examples that use MongoDB, HBase, Cassandra, Redis, CouchDB, Google App Engine Datastore and more. Looks at architecture and internals. Provides guidelines for optimal usage, performance tuning, and scalable configurations.

      "How do we design for data when traditional design techniques cannot extend to new database technologies? In this era of big data and the Internet of Things, it is essential that we have the tools we need to understand the data coming to us faster than ever before, and to design databases and data processing systems that can adapt easily to ever-changing data schemas and ever-changing business requirements. There must be no intellectual disconnect between data and the software that manages it. It must be possible to extract meaning and knowledge from data to drive artificial intelligence applications. Novel NoSQL data organization techniques must be used side-by-side with traditional SQL databases. Are existing data modeling techniques ready for all of this? The Concept and Object Modeling Notation (COMN) is able to cover the full spectrum of analysis and design. A single COMN model can represent the objects and concepts in the problem space, logical data design, and concrete NoSQL and SQL document, key-value, columnar, and relational database implementations. COMN models enable an unprecedented level of traceability of requirements to implementation. COMN models can also represent the static structure of software and the predicates that represent the patterns of meaning in databases. This book will teach you: the simple and familiar graphical notation of COMN with its three basic shapes and four line styles how to think about objects, concepts, types, and classes in the real world, using the ordinary meanings of English words that aren’t tangled with confused techno-speak how to express logical data designs that are freer from implementation considerations than is possible in any other notation how to understand key-value, document, columnar, and table-oriented database designs in logical and physical terms how to use COMN to specify physical database implementations in any NoSQL or SQL database with the precision necessary for model-driven development",

      "Optical character recognition (OCR) is the most prominent and successful example of pattern recognition to date. There are thousands of research papers and dozens of OCR products. Optical Character Rcognition: An Illustrated Guide to the Frontier offers a perspective on the performance of current OCR systems by illustrating and explaining actual OCR errors. The pictures and analysis provide insight into the strengths and weaknesses of current OCR systems, and a road map to future progress. Optical Character Recognition: An Illustrated Guide to the Frontier will pique the interest of users and developers of OCR products and desktop scanners, as well as teachers and students of pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, and information retrieval. The first chapter compares the character recognition abilities of humans and computers. The next four chapters present 280 illustrated examples of recognition errors, in a taxonomy consisting of Imaging Defects, Similar Symbols, Punctuation, and Typography. These examples were drawn from large-scale tests conducted by the authors. The final chapter discusses possible approaches for improving the accuracy of today's systems, and is followed by an annotated bibliography. Optical Character Recognition: An Illustrated Guide to the Frontier is suitable as a secondary text for a graduate level course on pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, and information retrieval, and as a reference for researchers and practitioners in industry.",

      "The evolution of Robotics lead us to aspire replacing human beings by autonomous robotic systems in the most discomforting or dangerous situations, and even to have them performing tasks that humans are incapable of. Such situations are often encountered when facing a catastrophic scenario and human rescue teams put themselves at risk in their heroic attempt to rescue victims. In nowadays society, the human life is highly valued and, consequently, Search and Rescue (SaR) missions became of extreme importance, precisely because their accomplishment can save several human lives. For that reason, rescue teams are heavily trained and, since they also comprise human beings, heavily equipped. However, they often lack technological tools to perform their mission better and in safety. The main objective of this work is to study, develop and validate a fully-integrated robotic system to eventually explore catastrophic scenarios, by providing a map of the area and the people it detected while performing its task. This is a vital information in SaR missions, and this work aims at achieving this without risking a human life in the process. To that end, a mobile robot with a Red-Blue-Green and Depth (RGB-D) sensor mounted on its top was used. Furthermore, all approaches and methods were implemented in Robot Operating System (ROS) and thoroughly analyzed to assess their accuracy and performance. However, due to hardware limitations, the results are comprehensively not optimal, but they still provide useful information that might be of great help in SaR missions. Moreover, the study and analysis of this type of sensor and its usability are valuable and are now available for upcoming developments. This work is part of the Cooperation between Human and rObotic teams in catastroPhic INcidents (CHOPIN) project, which intends to develop a support system for small-scale SaR missions in urban catastrophic scenarios by exploiting human-robot cooperation.",

      "While computers and other devices identify each other on networks or the Internet by using unique addresses made up of numbers, humans rely on the Domain Name System (DNS), the distributed database that allows us to identify machines by name. DNS does the work of translating domain names into numerical IP addresses, routing mail to its proper destination, and many other services, so that users require little or no knowledge of the system. If you're a network or system administrator, however, configuring, implementing, and maintaining DNS zones can be a formidable challenge. And now, with Windows Server 2003, an understanding of the workings of DNS is even more critical. DNS on Windows Server 20003 is a special Windows-oriented edition of the classic DNS and BIND, updated to document the many changes to DNS, large and small, found in Windows Server 2003. Veteran O'Reilly authors, Cricket Liu, Matt Larson, and Robbie Allen explain the whole system in terms of the new Windows Server 2003, from starting and stopping a DNS service to establishing an organization's namespace in the global hierarchy. Besides covering general issues like installing, setting up, and maintaining the server, DNS on Windows Server 2003 tackles the many issues specific to the new Windows environment, including the use of the dnscmd program to manage the Microsoft DNS Server from the command line and development using the WMI DNS provider to manage the name server programmatically. The book also documents new features of the Microsoft DNS Server in Windows Server 2003, including conditional forwarding and zone storage in Active Directory (AD) application partitions. DNS on Windows Server 2003 provides grounding in: Security issues System tuning Caching Zone change notification Troubleshooting Planning for growth If you're a Windows administrator, DNS on Windows Server 2003 is the operations manual you need for working with DNS every day. If you're a Windows user who simply wants to take the mystery out of the Internet, this book is a readable introduction to the Internet's architecture and inner workings.",

    "description":
      "Please note that the content of this book primarily consists of articles available from Wikipedia or other free sources online. DNS hijacking or DNS redirection is the practice of redirecting the resolution of Domain Name System (DNS) names to other DNS servers. This is done for malicious purposes such as phishing; for self-serving purposes by Internet service providers (ISPs) to direct users' HTTP traffic via the ISP's own webservers where advertisements are served, statistics can be collected, or other purposes of the ISP; and by DNS service providers to block access to sites which the user wishes to block because they are malicious or of an unwanted nature. One of the functions of a DNS server is to translate a domain name into an IP address that applications need to connect to an Internet resource such as a website. This functionality is defined in various internet standards that define the protocol in considerable detail. DNS servers are implicitly trusted by internet-facing computers and users to correctly resolve names to the actual addresses that are registered by the owners of an internet domain.",

      "DNS on Windows 2000 is a special Windows-oriented edition of the classic DNS and BIND. The Domain Name System (DNS) is one of the Internet's fundamental building blocks: the distributed host information database that's responsible for translating names into addresses, routing mail to its proper destination, and many other services. As the preface says, if you're using the Internet, you're already using DNS--even if you don't know it. Besides covering general issues like installing, setting up, and maintaining the server, DNS on Windows 2000 tackles those specific to the Windows environment: integration between DNS and Active Directory, conversion from BIND to the Microsoft DNS server, and registry settings. You'll also acquire a grounding in: Security issues System tuning Caching Zone change notification Troubleshooting Planning for growth If you're a Windows administrator, DNS on Windows 2000 is the operations manual you need for working with DNS every day; if you're a Windows user who simply wants to take the mystery out of the Internet, this book is a readable introduction to the Internet's architecture and inner workings. Topics include: What DNS does, how it works, and when you need to use it How to find your own place in the Internet's namespace Setting up name servers Integrating Active Directory with DNS Dynamic updates, storing zone information in Active Directory, and incremental zone transfers Using MX records to route mail Configuring hosts to use name servers Subdividing domains (parenting) Securing your name server: preventing unauthorized zone transfers Mapping one name to several servers for load sharing Troubleshooting: using nslookup, diagnosing common problems",

      "The development of the Internet has changed the environment for Geographical Information Systems (GIS), with the emphasis shifting from analysis to the sharing of data and information over the Internet thus making GIS more mobile and powerful. The Geography Mark-Up Language (GML) was developed as the standard language and is emerging as the foundation for Internet GIS. Geography Mark-Up Language: Foundation for the Geo-Web provides a broad coverage of the use of GML in different application areas, along with the technical means for building these applications. Starting from the basic concepts, this book works through all the important topics in both GML 2.0 and GML 3.0, with illustrations and worked examples to demonstrate its use. Organized into two sections, Volume I introduces readers to the new world of GML, and explains how it can be used across a broad range of GIS projects. It deals with the basic concepts of XML and GML, and enables readers to make decisions on the utility of GML in their projects and software acquisitions. Volume II is intended for the technical reader and answers questions on the meaning and structure of GML schema components, the development of GML application schemas, and the use of GML in connection with web services, legacy GIS and relational databases. Contains worked examples Covers all aspects of GML 3.0 from geometry and topology to units of measure, default styling and coverages Explains the Geo-Web and its impact on vertical applications Authored by leading figures in GML development This book is a must have for GIS vendors, system integrators and data providers; local/state/provincial and national government agencies; utilities and telecommunication companies; location-based services companies; data distributors; software developers and technical managers. It would make an excellent reference for mid and upper-level undergraduate students and Masters students taking technical GIS modules as part of a GIS or Technical Geography programmes.",

    "publishedDate": "2014",
    "description":
      "Geography Markup Language (GML) is composed of non-spatial information as properties of geographical features and spatial information as geometry. With the feature of XML-encoding and well-formed specification, GML has been widely used in various application systems as internal representation of geo-spatial data for its efficient interoperability in heterogeneous systems. This arises the demand to effectively manipulate GML data. The separate GML processing technology cannot provide a whole geo-spatial data management service for users. In this paper, we propose a GML data management framework and analyse how the relative technologies cooperate to meet the demand of geo-spatial data representing, processing and exchanging. Storage, index and query approaches, and corresponding integration technology are presented based on the proposed framework. The prototype of GML data management system (GDMS) was implemented based on the proposed framework.",

      "-- Includes case studies based on real world solution deployments with Vicinity, ATX, Ford and Hutchison 3G.-- Insights into differences between solutions for US and European marketplaces.-- Includes a software development kit for building a basic Location Service Solution.Mobile applications must be much smarter than desktop web applications. These applications need to know user's location, surroundings, and provide directions on how to get there. Developers face many challenges, including how to pinpoint the user's location, how to retrieve relevant spatial data from map databases that are often 20 Gigabytes in size, and how to support multiple clients. The mobility provided by the proliferation of wireless devices, such as Palm Pilots and onboard navigation systems presents a new class of opportunities and problems for application developers. This book provides an end-to-end solution guide to understand the issues in location-based services and build solutions that will sell. Complete with software and industry case studies, this book is an essential companion to anyone wanting to build the next killer application. The more than one million auto-based telematics terminals that have been installed by year-end 2001 are ample testimony of the opportunities and attractiveness of the mobile location services market. This large and growing installed base of subscribers also provides multiple implementation examples, which are incorporated into the text",

    "description":
      "Contemporary speech synthesis is perceived as inadequate for general adoption for user interaction, largely because it rests on an inadequate model of human speech production and perception. This book reviews the underlying model, brings out areas of inadequacy and suggests how improvements might be made. It is argued that a greater understanding of the fine detail of speech will enable new research and application initiatives. The authors draw on their extensive experience in both theoretical and applied research to bring forward proposals for producing more natural sounding synthetic speech. Provides an overview of the current work in speech synthesis, including a critical review of markup systems (including XML and SSML) embedded in interactive applications. Argues that naturalness in synthesis will benefit from enhancements to underlying models of prosody which more accurately account for the properties of human speech, yet can also be productively transferred to speech synthesis. Emphasises the importance of an explicit and extensible architecture as the basis for future developments, stressing particularly the importance of close modelling of expressive and emotive content - key features of naturalness. Focuses on the dynamic nature of prosody, as opposed to the more usual static treatment, especially as an adaptive model compliant with pragmatic and environmental constraints. \"Developments in Speech Synthesis\" provides the basis for a comprehensive approach that will appeal to speech synthesis and language technology engineers specialising in building dialogue systems. It will also be an invaluable resource for computer science and engineering students at both advanced undergraduate and postgraduate levels, as well as researchers in the general field of speech synthesis.",

      "The annual Text, Speech and Dialogue Conference (TSD), which originated in 1998, is now starting its second decade. So far almost 900 authors from 45 countries have contributed to the proceedings. TSD constitutes a recognizedplatform for the presen- tion and discussion of state-of-the-art technology and recent achievements in the ?eld of natural language processing. It has become an interdisciplinary forum, interweaving the themes of speech technology and language processing. The conference attracts - searchers not only from Central and Eastern Europe, but also from other parts of the world. Indeed, one of its goals has always been to bring together NLP researchers with different interests from different parts of the world and to promote their mutual co- eration. One of the ambitions of the conference is, as its title says, not only to deal with dialogue systems as such, but also to contribute to improving dialogue between researchers in the two areas of NLP, i. e. , between text and speech people. In our view, the TSD conference was successful in this respect in 2008 as well. This volume contains the proceedings of the 11th TSD conference, held in Brno, Czech Republic in September 2008. Following the review process, 79 papers were - ceptedoutof173submitted,anacceptancerateof45. 7%.",

      "Media Resource Control Protocol (MRCP) is a new IETF protocol, providing a key enabling technology that eases the integration of speech technologies into network equipment and accelerates their adoption resulting in exciting and compelling interactive services to be delivered over the telephone. MRCP leverages IP telephony and Web technologies such as SIP, HTTP, and XML (Extensible Markup Language) to deliver an open standard, vendor-independent, and versatile interface to speech engines. Speech Processing for IP Networks brings these technologies together into a single volume, giving the reader a solid technical understanding of the principles of MRCP, how it leverages other protocols and specifications for its operation, and how it is applied in modern IP-based telecommunication networks. Focusing on the MRCPv2 standard developed by the IETF SpeechSC Working Group, this book will also provide an overview of its precursor, MRCPv1. Speech Processing for IP Networks: Gives a complete background on the technologies required by MRCP to function, including SIP (Session Initiation Protocol), RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol), and HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). Covers relevant W3C data representation formats including Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML), Speech Recognition Grammar Specification (SRGS), Semantic Interpretation for Speech Recognition (SISR), and Pronunciation Lexicon Specification (PLS). Describes VoiceXML - the leading approach for programming cutting-edge speech applications and a key driver to the development of many of MRCP’s features. Explains advanced topics such as VoiceXML and MRCP interworking. This text will be an invaluable resource for technical managers, product managers, software developers, and technical marketing professionals working for network equipment manufacturers, speech engine vendors, and network operators. Advanced students on computer science and engineering courses will also find this to be a useful guide.",

      "This reference and handbook describes theory, algorithms and applications of the Global Positioning System (GPS/Glonass/Galileo/Compass). It is primarily based on source-code descriptions of the KSGsoft program developed at the GFZ in Potsdam. The theory and algorithms are extended and verified for a new development of a multi-functional GPS/Galileo software. Besides the concepts such as the unified GPS data processing method, the diagonalisation algorithm, the adaptive Kalman filter, the general ambiguity search criteria, and the algebraic solution of variation equation reported in the first edition, the equivalence theorem of the GPS algorithms, the independent parameterisation method, and the alternative solar radiation model reported in the second edition, the modernisation of the GNSS system, the new development of the theory and algorithms, and research in broad applications are supplemented in this new edition. Mathematically rigorous, the book begins with the introduction, the basics of coordinate and time systems and satellite orbits, as well as GPS observables, and deals with topics such as physical influences, observation equations and their parameterisation, adjustment and filtering, ambiguity resolution, software development and data processing and the determination of perturbed orbits.",

      "Over a century ago, psychologists who were fascinated with religion began to study and write about it. Theologians and religious practitioners have responded to this literature, producing a fascinating dialogue that deals with our fundamental und- standings about the human person and our place in the world. This book provides an introduction to the important conversations that have developed out of these interchanges. The dialogue between psychology and religion is difficult to study for a number of reasons. First, it requires knowledge of both psychology and religion. People with a background in psychology often lack a solid understanding of the religious traditions they wish to study, and theologians may not be up to date on the latest developments in psychology. Second, it requires conceptual tools to organize the material and understand the basic problems involved in any attempt to connect the science of psychology with religion. These concepts can be found in many places, for instance in the writings of philosophers of science, but they are complex and often hard to follow for those without a proper theological and philosophical ba- ground. Finally, authors who write on the topic come to the study of psychology and religion from a variety of academic and personal backgrounds. This makes for wonderful diversity in conversations, but it makes understanding and mastery of the material quite difficult.",

    "description":
      "PSYCHOLOGY: CONCEPTS AND APPLICATIONS, Fourth Edition, offers a concept-based approach supported by a unique pedagogical framework. Author Jeff Nevid provides a broad view of psychology that includes history, major theories, research methods, and important research findings as well as applications of contemporary research to the problems and challenges faced in everyday life. Nevid developed the effective teaching devices in this text based on a comprehensive system derived from research on learning and memory as well as his own research on textbook pedagogy. The text’s successful modular format organizes each chapter into manageable instructional units that help students focus on one topic at a time within the context of a larger chapter structure. The material also incorporates four goals that Nevid refers to as the Four E’s of Effective Learning: Engaging Student Interest, Encoding Information, Elaborating Meaning, and Evaluating Progress. In the Fourth Edition, Nevid employs a new IDEA Model of Course Assessment--unique to this text--which maps specific learning goals (tied to APA goals) to measurable skills students acquire in their first exposure to psychology. Executed throughout each chapter, the model presents learning objectives that are expressed in the form of active learning verbs, and linked to measurable learning outcomes. The model is integrated with the test-item file, making it easy for instructors to select items measuring these particular outcomes.

      "This is a title in the modular \"Principles in Psychology Series\", designed for A-level and other introductory courses, aiming to provide students embarking on psychology courses with the necessary background and context. One aspect of this is to consider contemporary psychology in the light of its historical development. Another aspect is to examine some of the major controversies which have dominated psychology over the centuries. Yet another aspect is to consider some of the major areas of psychology eg social, developmental, cognitive in terms of what they have to offer in the quest for an understanding of human behaviour.; The book also addresses key issues which need to be considered as psychology matures into a fully fledged experimental and scientific discipline. For example, how much do laboratory experiments tell us about how people behave in the real world? And how far is it ethically permissable for psychologists to go in their pursuit of knowledge?",

      "Astronomy on Trial systematically and convincingly argues against every aspect of the theory behind the idea of the \"Big Bang.\" Using a readable style that incorporates the laws of physics, Roy C. Martin exposes the impossibilities that have been so commonly manipulated to support the Big Bang theory. He carefully explains the absurdities that have come to represent modern day cosmology and high-energy physics that have arisen from the group-think phenomenon. Martin reveals this group-think as the tendency of scientists to fit the astronomical observational data that flow into context within the standard theories already established by the community of cosmologists. The author's witty, point-by-point exposition of the impossibility of the Big Bang not only provides insights into this one situation, but reveals a troubling trend of a lack of skepticism in scientific research in general that calls for a reevaluation of conclusions in all other fields of science.",

      "With this newly revised 9th edition of FOUNDATIONS OF ASTRONOMY, Mike Seeds' goal is to help students use astronomy to understand science and use science to understand what we are. Fascinating and engaging, this text illustrates the scientific method and guides students to answer these fundamental questions: What are we? and How do we know? In discussing the interplay between evidence and hypothesis, Seeds provides not just facts, but a conceptual framework for understanding the logic of science. The book vividly conveys his love of astronomy, and illustrates how students can comprehend their place in the universe by grasping a small set of physical laws. Crafting a story about astronomy, Mike shows students how to ask questions to gradually puzzle out the beautiful secrets of the physical world. Mathematics is incorporated into the text (and in separate sections for easy reference), but the book's arguments do not depend on mathematical reasoning, keeping even math-averse students engaged. The revision addresses new developments in astrophysics and cosmology, plus the latest discoveries, including evidence of a new world beyond Pluto and new evidence of dark energy and the acceleration of the universe. Students are also provided with an online assessment tool, called AceAstronomy. Designed specifically to help students prepare for tests and exams, AceAstronomy improves conceptual understanding by providing a personalized learning plan based on a pre-test diagnostic.

      "Solomon/Martin/Martin/Berg, BIOLOGY is often described as the best majors text for LEARNING biology. Working like a built-in study guide, the superbly integrated, inquiry-based learning system guides you through every chapter. Key concepts appear clearly at the beginning of each chapter and learning objectives start each section. You can quickly check the key points at the end of each section before moving on to the next one. At the end of the chapter a specially focused summary provides further reinforcement of the learning objectives and you are given the opportunity to test your understanding of the material. The tenth edition offers expanded integration of the text's five guiding themes of biology (the evolution of life, the transmission of biological information, the flow of energy through living systems, interactions among biological systems, and the inter-relationship of structure and function).

This course typically fulfills a general education requirement, and rather than emphasizing mastery of technical topics, it focuses on the understanding of biological ideas and concepts, how they relate to real life, and appreciating the scientific methods and thought processes. Given the authors' work in and dedication to science education, this text's writing style, pedagogy, and integrated support package are all based on classroom-tested teaching strategies and learning theory. The result is a learning program that enhances the effectiveness & efficiency of the teaching and learning experience in the introductory biology course like no other before it.",

Systems biology is the study of the interconnected aspect of molecular, cellular, tissue, whole animal and ecological processes, and comprises mathematical and mechanistic studies of dynamical, mesoscopic, open, spatiotemporally defined, nonlinear, complex systems that are far from thermodynamic equilibrium.",

      "From the pet that we live with and care for, to news items such as animal cloning, and the use of various creatures in film, television and advertising, animals are a constant presence in our lives. Animal is a timely overview of the many ways in which we live with animals, and assesses many of the paradoxes of our relationships with them: for example, why is the pet that sits by the dinner table never for eating? Examining novels such as Charlotte’s Web, films such as Old Yeller and Babe, science and advertising, fashion and philosophy, Animal also evaluates the ways in which we think about animals and challenges a number of the assumptions we hold. Why is it, for example, that animals are such a constant presence in children’s literature? And what does it mean to wear fake fur? Is fake fur an ethical avoidance of animal suffering, or merely a sanitized version of the unacceptable use of animals as clothing? Neither evangelical nor proselytizing, Animal invites the reader to think beyond the boundaries of a subject that has a direct effect on our day-to-day lives.",

At the beginning of this century these relationships were dominated by human needs and interests, modernization was a project which was attached to the goal of progress and animals were merely resources to be used on the path towards human fulfilment. As the century comes to an end these relationships are increasingly being subjected to criticism. We are now urged to be more sensitive and compassionate to animal needs and interests. This book focuses on social change and animals, it is concerned with how humans relate to animals and how this has changed and why. Moreover, it highlights",

      "This volume was written by A. C. Seward, prestigious Professor of Botany at The University of Cambridge and member of the Royal Society at the age of just thirty-five. At the time of his death in 1941, the author of this 1932 text was considered to be one of the world's greatest botanists. Here, Seward addresses the general reader with little or no knowledge of botany, using his passion for plants to educate them about the workings and wonders of these organisms. He is careful to use simple and accessible language to inspire interest, rather than to baffle the reader with unfamiliar jargon. Seward's illustrated book is an enthusiastically written introduction to plants, explaining the functions of their leaves, roots and seeds whilst also engaging with the aspects of their evolution which have lead them, in the eyes of this admired botanist, to claim superiority of form over many animals.",

How did this array of form and habitat come about, and how do we humans interact with the plant kingdom? This unique new textbook provides a refreshing and stimulating consideration of these questions and throws light in a new way on the complexity, ecology, evolution and development of plants and our relationship with them. Illustrated throughout with numerous line diagrams and beautiful colour photographs, the book provides a comprehensive introduction to the fascinating lives that plants lead and the way in which our lives are inextricably linked to theirs. It will be particularly useful to students seeking a more ecological and process-oriented approach than is available in other plant science textbooks.",

      "Corbin argues that with few exceptions people living before the eighteenth century knew nothing of the attractions of the coast, the visual delight of the sea, the desire to brave the force of the waves or to feel the coolness of sand against the skin. The image of the ocean in the popular consciousness was coloured by Biblical and mythical recollections of sea monsters, voracious whales, and catastrophic floods. It was perceived as sinister and unchanging, a dark, unfathomable force inspiring horror rather than attraction. These associations of catastrophe and fear in the minds of Europeans intensified the repulsion they felt towards deserted and dismal shores.",

    "description":
      "For a century, the history of the novel has been written in terms of nations and territories: the English novel, the French novel, the American novel. But what if novels were viewed in terms of the seas that unite these different lands? Examining works across two centuries, The Novel and the Sea recounts the novel's rise, told from the perspective of the ship's deck and the allure of the oceans in the modern cultural imagination. Margaret Cohen moors the novel to overseas exploration and work at sea, framing its emergence as a transatlantic history, steeped in the adventures and risks of the maritime frontier. Cohen explores how Robinson Crusoe competed with the best-selling nautical literature of the time by dramatizing remarkable conditions, from the wonders of unknown lands to storms, shipwrecks, and pirates. She considers James Fenimore Cooper's refashioning of the adventure novel in postcolonial America, and a change in literary poetics toward new frontiers and to the maritime labor and technology of the nineteenth century. Cohen shows how Jules Verne reworked adventures at sea into science fiction; how Melville, Hugo, and Conrad navigated the foggy waters of language and thought; and how detective and spy fiction built on sea fiction's problem-solving devices. She also discusses the transformation of the ocean from a theater of skilled work to an environment of pristine nature and the sublime. A significant literary history, The Novel and the Sea challenges readers to rethink their land-locked assumptions about the novel.",

    "description":
      "A monumental retelling of world history through the lens of maritime enterprise, revealing in breathtaking depth how people first came into contact with one another by ocean and river, lake and stream, and how goods, languages, religions, and entire cultures spread across and along the world’s waterways, bringing together civilizations and defining what makes us most human. Lincoln Paine takes us back to the origins of long-distance migration by sea with our ancestors’ first forays from Africa and Eurasia to Australia and the Americas. He demonstrates the critical role of maritime trade to the civilizations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Indus Valley. He reacquaints us with the great seafaring cultures of antiquity like those of the Phoenicians and Greeks, as well as those of India and Southeast and East Asia, who parlayed their navigational skills, shipbuilding techniques, and commercial acumen to establish thriving overseas colonies and trade routes in the centuries leading up to the age of European expansion. And finally, his narrative traces how commercial shipping and naval warfare brought about the enormous demographic, cultural, and political changes that have globalized the world throughout the post–Cold War era. This tremendously readable intellectual adventure shows us the world in a new light, in which the sea reigns supreme. We find out how a once-enslaved East African king brought Islam to his people, what the American “sail-around territories” were, and what the Song Dynasty did with twenty-wheel, human-powered paddleboats with twenty paddle wheels and up to three hundred crew. Above all, Paine makes clear how the rise and fall of civilizations can be linked to the sea. An accomplishment of both great sweep and illuminating detail, The Sea and Civilization is a stunning work of history.",

      "The fact that the Montego Bay Convention has been only ratified by 37 States at present and that it will be some time before the 60 ratifications required by Article 308 are achieved has not prevented states from acting in accordance with the rules drawn up by the Conference. Close on one hundred states have established either exclusive economic zones broadly modelled on Part V or 200-nautical-mile fishery zones and drawn on the principles laid down for exploiting living resources. Although these laws have been formulated unilaterally by states, international custom, since the judgement by the International Court of Justice in the Fisheries Case of 18 December 1951, is derived from concordant national rules. This shift began even before the Conference ended, and has been consolidated since then. Moreover, the regime governing the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction defined by Part XI, which was the stumbling block of the Conference, is subject to transitional arrangements on the basis of two resolutions adopted in the Conference's Final Act, one providing for the establishment of a Preparatory Commission and the other on the preliminary activities of pioneer investors. This two-volume work, an earlier edition of which appeared in French, has been written by a team of experts of international renown. It presents an analysis of the Convention with an additional Chapter on the legal regime governing underwater archaeological and historical objects.",

      "At the heart of this vibrant saga is a vast ship, the Ibis. Its destiny is a tumultuous voyage across the Indian Ocean; its purpose, to fight China's vicious nineteenth-century Opium Wars. As for the crew, they are a motley array of sailors and stowaways, coolies and convicts. In a time of colonial upheaval, fate has thrown together a diverse cast of Indians and Westerners, from a bankrupt raja to a widowed tribeswoman, from a mulatto American freedman to a freespirited French orphan. As their old family ties are washed away, they, like their historical counterparts, come to view themselves as jahaj-bhais, or ship-brothers. An unlikely dynasty is born, which will span continents, races, and generations. The vast sweep of this historical adventure spans the lush poppy fields of the Ganges, the rolling high seas, the exotic backstreets of Canton. But it is the panorama of characters, whose diaspora encapsulates the vexed colonial history of the East itself, that makes Sea of Poppies so breathtakingly alive—a masterpiece from one of the world's finest novelists.",

      "This book explores the unprecedented surge or oceanic feeling in the aesthetic expression of the romantic century. As secular thought began to displace the certainties of a sacral universe, the oceans that give life to our planet offered a symbol of eternity, rooted in the experience of nature rather than Biblical tradition. Images of the sea permeated the minds of the early Romantics, became a significant ingredient of romantic expression, and continued to emerge in the language, literature, art, and music of the nineteenth century. These pages document the evidence for this oceanic consciousness in some of the most creative minds of that century.",

    "description":
      "Digital games offer a vast range of engaging experiences, from the serene exploration of beautifully rendered landscapes to the deeply cognitive challenges presented by strategic simulations to the adrenaline rush of competitive team-based shoot-outs. Digital games enable experiences that are considerably different from a reader's engagement with literature or a moviegoer's experience of a movie. In In-Game, Gordon Calleja examines what exactly it is that makes digital games so uniquely involving and offers a new, more precise, and game-specific formulation of this involvement. One of the most commonly yet vaguely deployed concepts in the industry and academia alike is immersion--a player's sensation of inhabiting the space represented onscreen. Overuse of this term has diminished its analytical value and confused its meaning, both in analysis and design. Rather than conceiving of immersion as a single experience, Calleja views it as blending different experiential phenomena afforded by involving gameplay. He proposes a framework (based on qualitative research) to describe these phenomena: the player involvement model. This model encompasses two constituent temporal phases--the macro, representing offline involvement, and the micro, representing moment-to-moment involvement during gameplay--as well as six dimensions of player involvement: kinesthetic, spatial, shared, narrative, affective, and ludic. The intensified and internalized experiential blend can culminate in incorporation--a concept that Calleja proposes as an alternative to the problematic immersion. Incorporation, he argues, is a more accurate metaphor, providing a robust foundation for future research and design.",

      "In this new edition of her groundbreaking social history The Girl and the Game (2002), M. Ann Hall updates her lively narrative of how women resisted masculine hegemony in Canadian sport and, in turn, how their efforts were opposed and sometimes supported by men. The second edition of The Girl and the Game begins with an important new chapter on aboriginal women and their interaction with early sport and ends with a new chapter on how trends and issues facing contemporary women in Canadian sport have their origins in the past. Other new sections focus on gender and the residential school system, the promotion of women's track and field, the 1928 summer Olympics and the Matchless Six, and aboriginal sportswomen. As in the first edition, Hall introduces her audience to more obscure Canadian female athletes rather than focusing her discussion on household names. The introduction to the new edition has been updated to reflect the content changes in the narrative. To increase appeal to the course market, chapter titles are more descriptive, the text has been revised to include more subsections, and the 52 black and white images are placed throughout the text.",
